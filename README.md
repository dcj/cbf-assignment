# cbf-assignment

This is simply a copy of the cbf-assignment project (stubbed out framework) for the [Coursera Introduction to Recommender Systems MOOC](https://class.coursera.org/recsys-001/class/index)

## Running the project

	mvn package
	sh ./target/bin/run-cbf

But the shell script doesn't work for me, if you have the same issue,
try

	sh ./bin/run-cbf
